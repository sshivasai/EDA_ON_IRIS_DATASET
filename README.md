# EDA_ON_IRIS_DATASET


Dataset: Iris Dataset: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set]
  * A simple dataset to learn the basics.
  * 3 flowers of Iris species. [see images on wikipedia link above]
  * 1936 by Ronald Fisher.
  * Petal and Sepal: http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~petersd/666/html/iris_with_labels.jpg
  *  Objective: Classify a new flower as belonging to one of the 3 classes given the 4 features.



**Observations**
1. petal_length and petal_width are the most useful features to identify various flower types.
2. While Setosa can be easily identified (linearly seperable), Virnica and Versicolor have some overlap (almost linearly seperable).
3. We can find "lines" and "if-else" conditions to build a simple model to classify the flower types.


**Observation(s):**
1. Using sepal_length and sepal_width features, we can distinguish Setosa flowers from others.
2. Seperating Versicolor from Viginica is much harder as they have considerable overlap.
